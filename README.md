# MEAN Blog
A simple blog using the MEAN stack:
-  mongo
-  express
-  angular (not much stuff using angular though)
-  node (with pug -previously known as Jade- for templating on the server side)

## Installation
You only need to run `npm install` and then `npm start` or `node index.js` and you'll be set.

### Online version
Currently there is a version hosted at: [Heroku - Mean Blog] (https://mean-blog-test.herokuapp.com/) using a mongoDB instance at mLab.
